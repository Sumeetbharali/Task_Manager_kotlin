Task Manager App using RecyclerView and Room Database

This is a task manager application built with Kotlin, utilizing RecyclerView for displaying tasks and Room Database for local data storage. The app follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

app:

Contains the main code for the application.
manifests: Android manifest files.
java/com.example.taskmanager: Kotlin source files.
data: Contains data-related classes.
database: Room database setup (entities, DAOs, database instance).
repository: Repositories for accessing data from different sources (local in this case).
ui: UI components implemented using MVVM architecture.
adapters: RecyclerView adapters for task lists.
viewmodels: ViewModels for managing UI-related data.
views: Activities or Fragments for displaying task lists and details.
utils: Utility classes.
res: Resources including layouts, drawables, and values.
build.gradle: Project-level Gradle build file.

app/build.gradle: App-level Gradle build file where dependencies are declared.

How to Run the App

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git



Open Android Studio:

Open Android Studio and select Open an existing Android Studio project.
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the root folder.
Run the app:

Connect your Android device or use an emulator.
Build and run the project using the Run button in Android Studio.
MVVM Architecture

The app follows MVVM architecture principles:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. Includes entities defined for Room database, repositories for accessing data, and data sources.

View: Displays data to the user and sends user interactions to the ViewModel.

ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. Manages UI-related data and communicates with the Model to fetch and save data.

Features

Task List: Displays a list of tasks using RecyclerView.
Add/Edit/Delete Tasks: Functionality to add
